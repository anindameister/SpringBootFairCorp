- JS frontend framework is vue js
- JS libraries are there like JQuery, Loadash, axios
- library can be imported in our code to do a specific task, Professor used the term **Functions**
- Framework example could be SpringBoot for Java so SpringBoot is the Java framework
- The term framework could be broken to frame+work, so it frames your work which is your code. So JS framework would froame your JS code. It's like photo frame. So we have a frame, a inside the frame we put the photo. Exactly, is the scenario here.

- imperative paradigm: js,java,c:- executed one after the other
- declarative paradigm: more like HTML. you dont define the other, but describe how things are supposed to be in a declarative way.more to be checked later

- using the base vue files and doing 
```
npm install
```
- so we have the package.json file.. we can rename stuffs there and change the commands based on our convenience. Right now, we have "npm serve" we could change that to "npm start" by renaming the right stuff in package.json
